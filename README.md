## Welcome to My Profile 👋

Hello there! This is my GitHub profile for work/school.

I'm Sam, currently studying CompSci in the United Kingdom.

My expertise mostly consists of backend software development, I typically work on servers/APIs with Python or Javascript.

I do a little bit of game development when I find the spare time.
